  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
  <% contact_curatend_support = link_to 'contact CurateND support', new_help_request_path, class: 'help-report-problem request-help' %>
  <dl>
    <dt>What are persistent URLs?</dt>
    <dd>
      A persistent URL is a URL that does not break.
      It is expected to work and return documents from CurateND for a long time, where a “long time” is more than ten years.
    </dd>

    <dt>What is a DOI?</dt>
    <dd>
      This is an acronym for <em>digital object identifier</em>, and it is a long-term identifier for a work.
      A DOI can be turned into a persistent URL by prefixing it with <tt>http://dx.doi.org/</tt>.
      Any item in CurateND that has a value for <b>publisher</b> can be assigned a DOI.
    </dd>

    <dt>How long is long term?</dt>
    <dd>
      Compared to books, computers are the mere infants on the block, but that said, “long term” when it comes to computers is measured in decades.
    </dd>

    <dt>What is a Creative Commons license?</dt>
    <dd>
      A Creative Commons license is one of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">set of licenses</a> providing others various degrees of permission for use. Some of these permissions require attribution, allow for commercial use and re-use, or permit others to make derivative works.
    </dd>

    <dt>How does someone find something that was self-submitted?</dt>
    <dd>
      Try searching for your work from inside CurateND itself.
      You will need to log-in if your work is not visible to the public.
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I load large numbers of collections or files?</dt>
    <dd>
      The batch ingest of files is still in development.
      If you have a large number of files—more than a dozen or so—please <%= contact_curatend_support %>, and we can work with you directly.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is there a priority list or order for what can be archived?</dt>
    <dd>
      The short answer to this question is, “No”.
      The long answer is, “If you are an individual and you have individual things to contribute, then by all means, please do.
      If you have many things to contribute, then let’s work together to get started.”
    </dd>

    <dt>What does preservation mean? Can anyone edit the documents I deposit?</dt>
    <dd>
      Preservation means we are concerned about keeping your files intact, now and tomorrow.
      We keep copies of your files, and we make sure they do not change over time.
      We also pay attention to obsolete file formats (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar">WordStar</a>), and try to translate your files into more modern formats. Additionally, we never edit your content. And files are never deleted; new versions are stored alongside the old ones (with some exceptions).
    </dd>

    <dt>What is the process for digitizing collections from departments?</dt>
    <dd>
      The process will vary from department to department.
      If you have content that needs digitizing before being added to CurateND, please <%= contact_curatend_support %>.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is there a concern that there will be a lot of junk data submitted? Is there a content review?</dt>
    <dd>
      Yes, there is a review process.
      Content that is deposited into CurateND is examined for various characteristics such as completeness and academic integrity.
    </dd>

    <dt>How can I keep a work private, but still allow collaborators outside campus to view it?</dt>
    <dd>
      For now outside collaborators are not able to do anything except read public content from the repository.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is there a work type for unpublished materials?</dt>
    <dd>
      No, items in the repository are centered around specific formats such as articles, books, data sets, collections, etc.
      Pick the format that most closely matches your unpublished materials when depositing them.
    </dd>

    <dt>Can anyone outside of ND deposit works?</dt>
    <dd>No.</dd>

    <dt>Can works be deleted?</dt>
    <dd>
      No, not really.
      For items you have deposited, you can mark them as having private access, which will restrict who can view and download the content.
      If something is deposited incorrectly, please <%= contact_curatend_support %>.
    </dd>

    <dt>Do people who leave or graduate from Notre Dame still have access to CurateND?</dt>
    <dd>
      As long as the person retains a NetID, they have the ability to view private content and to upload items to CurateND.
      Everyone in the world always has the ability to read public content in CurateND.
    </dd>

    <dt>Can one search by academic department?</dt>
    <dd>
      No, not yet.

      No, this is not a feature of the repository.
    </dd>

    <dt>Will CurateND be indexed by search engines?</dt>
    <dd>
      Yes.
    </dd>

    <dt>What is the difference between an article and a document?</dt>
    <dd>

    </dd>

    <dt>Can I put links to my CurateND profile page on other webpages?</dt>

    </dd>

    <dt>Is research done at the university property of the university or researcher?</dt>
