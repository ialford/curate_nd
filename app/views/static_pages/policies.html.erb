      CurateND is a research repository designed to help manage and preserve original academic work, collections, and related content produced by members of the University of Notre Dame community and to facilitate global discovery, access and sharing<sup><a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.
      To this end, CurateND welcomes the contribution of any scholarly works and supporting materials created by individuals or collaborations affiliated with Notre Dame that can advance research for the greater scholarly community, regardless of digital format (text, data, image).
      In addition, CurateND welcomes scholarly materials curatyed and/or digitized by the Hesburgh Libraries or campus partners, such as rare, ephemeral, or endangered works and collections.
      All items should be in completed form, even if amenable to future updates.
      Records generated in the course of official University business may only be included in CurateND with the permission of the <a href="http://archives.nd.edu/contacts/">University Archives</a><sup><a id="fnref:2" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.
      Not all works are appropriate for CurateND; for example, commercially licensed digital products, “popular” works aimed at a general audience, or University Records as defined in the <a href="http://policy.nd.edu/policy_files/Records%20Management%20Archives%202015.pdf">University’s Records Management and Archives Policy</a>.

     Uploaded works must go through a multi-step review process that includes factors such as appropriateness of content according to the <a name=content>CurateND Content in Scope Policy</a>, rights management, and metadata review. This process helps us fulfill our promise to help you manage and preserve your works so that they are globally discoverable, accessible, and sharable.
<p>
For those who choose to self-deposit, please know that we will review your submission, and may contact you with questions or recommendations. If your project is especially complex or you are unsure of any aspect of the process, a member of the CurateND team will help you prepare and deposit your work(s) and associated data.
