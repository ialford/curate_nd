    <p><%= t('sufia.product_name') %> offers the following licenses for deposited
    items.
    The majority come from the set of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons licenses</a>.
    See these <a href="https://creativecommons.org/examples">examples</a> of
    uses of Creative Commons licenses. CurateND originally offered 3.0 US licenses and continues to support them but has added support for Creative Commons 4.0 licenses and encourages those submitting new objects to consider using them instead.

    <li><b>Attribution 4.0: CC BY</b><br/>
      With this license, you allow others to "distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials."
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0: CC BY-SA</b><br/>
      With this license, you allow others to "remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to 'copyleft' free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects."
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution-NoDerivs 4.0: CC BY-ND</b><br/>
      With this license, you allow "redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as [the licensed object] is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you."
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0: CC BY-NC</b><br/>
      With this license, you allow others to "remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don't have to license their derivative works on the same terms."
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0: CC BY-NC-SA</b><br/>
      With this license, you allow others to "remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms."
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0: CC BY-NC-ND</b><br/>
      With this license, you only allow others to "download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can't change them in any way or use them commercially."
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution 3.0: CC BY</b><br/>
      With this license you allow others to "distribute, remix, tweak, and
      build" on your deposited content—including for commercial purposes—provided
      they attribute you as the original creator. CurateND supports both the United States and International (Unported) versions of this license.
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution-Share-Alike 3.0: CC BY-SA</b> <br/>
      With this license you allow others to "remix, tweak, and build" on your
      deposited content, including for commercial uses, provided they attribute
      you as the original creator AND incorporate the same level of licensing
      (i.e., CC BY-SA) for the newly resulting creation. "All new works based
      on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow
      commercial use."
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution-Non-Commercial 3.0: CC BY-NC</b><br/>
      With this license you allow others to "remix, tweak, and build" on your
      content in non-commercial ways. While they must credit you as the
      original creator and while the remixed, tweaked, or expanded upon content
      must remain non-commercial, they do not have to apply identical license
      terms on the new content.
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0: CC BY-ND</b><br/>
      With this license you permit "redistribution, commercial and
      non-commercial," provided the content remains unaltered and intact (i.e.,
      whole) and provided you are attributed as the original creator.
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 CC BY-NC-ND</b><br/>
      With this license you share your work with others and allow them to
      download your work, provided they attribute you as the creator and
      refrain from changing the content in any way and from using it for
      commercial means.
    </li>
    <li><b>Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share-Alike 3.0: CC BY-NC-SA</b><br/>
      With this license you allow others to "remix, tweak, and build" on your
      content in non-commercial ways, provided they give you credit (as the
      original creator) and also apply the same license level to the newly
      resulting creations.
    </li>
    <li><b>Public Domain Mark 1.0 </b><br/>
      When content is in the public domain, it has no known copyright owner.
    </li>
    <li><b>CC0 1.0 Universal </b><br/>
      With this license you are waiving your rights as copyright owner to the
      content you upload. This means your content may be distributed and reused
      without attribution, without restriction. CC0 is a license that one
      applies to one's own work; rarely does one apply it to another's work,
      unless one has the appropriate rights to do so.
    </li>
    <li><b>All rights reserved</b><br/>
      With this license you—as the copyright holder—reserve all rights held
      under copyright law, such as for distribution and creation of derivative
      works. This means that no one can use your content in a work—such as a
      presentation or article—or create derivatives from it without your
      permission.
